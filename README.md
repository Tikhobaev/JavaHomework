# Elevators
## Short description
* You can specify the number of elevators and floors
* Main rule: elevators are switched on depending on the number of passengers 
(like cash registers in large supermarkets)
* Exception: elevator will pick up people if they are
on the same floor with it
* There are also some more features which help to create the 
optimal balance of the total elevator mileage and passenger waiting time
